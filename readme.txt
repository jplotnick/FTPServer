HW4 readme:

	In order for FTP server to build and run, the ftpServer.c, ftpResponses.h, and ftpResponses.c files must be in the same folder along with a valid config file named FtpServer.conf. To compile the code, enter the command "gcc ftpServer.c ftpResponses.c -o ftpClient" and to run enter "ftpClient <logFile> <ipAddr>".
